1) Is String a keyword in Java?
No string is not a keyword. It is a "final class" in java.lang package 
which is used to represent set of characters

2) In how many ways we can create String Object in Java?

The String object can be created in two ways:
1) Using "String literals"
2) Using new keyword.

String str  ="Rahul Sah";             //created using string literal
String str = new String("Rahul Sah"); //created using new Keyword

The object created using String "new" keyword is created in the Heap Memory.
The object created using String literal is created in String constant pool.

4) What is string constant pool?

String objects are most used data objects in Java.
 Hence, java has a special arrangement to store the string objects.
 String Constant Pool is one such arrangement.
 String Constant Pool is the memory space in heap memory specially allocated to 
 store the string objects created using string literals.
 In String Constant Pool, there will be no two string objects having the same content.

Whenever you create a string object using string literal,
JVM first checks the content of the object to be created.
If there exist an object in the string constant pool with the same content,
then it returns the reference of that object. It doesn’t create a new object.
If the content is different from the existing objects then only it creates new object.
