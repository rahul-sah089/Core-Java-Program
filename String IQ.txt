1) What are different ways to create String Object?

We can create String object using new operator like any normal java class or 
we can use double quotes to create a String object. 
There are several constructors available in String class to get String from char array, byte array, StringBuffer and StringBuilder.

String str = new String("abc");
String str1 = "abc";

When we create a String using double quotes, JVM looks in the String pool to find if any other String is stored with same value.
If found, it just returns the reference to that String object else it creates a new String object with given value and stores it in the String pool.
When we use new operator, JVM creates the String object but don’t store it into the String Pool.
We can use intern() method to store the String object into String pool or return the reference 
if there is already a String with equal value present in the pool.

2) Write a method that will remove given character from the String?

We can use replaceAll method to replace all the occurance of a String with another String. 
The important point to note is that it accepts String as argument,
 so we will use Character class to create String and use it to replace all the characters with empty String.

    private static String removeChar(String str, char c) {
        if (str == null)
            return null;
        return str.replaceAll(Character.toString(c), "");
    }

3) How can we make String upper case or lower case?

We can use String class toUpperCase and toLowerCase methods to get the String in all upper case or lower case.
These methods have a variant that accepts Locale argument and use that locale rules to convert String to upper or lower case.


4) What is String subSequence method?

Java 1.4 introduced CharSequence interface and String implements this interface, 
this is the only reason for the implementation of subSequence method in String class. 
Internally it invokes the String substring method.
